# Podcasts Reviews Inferential Statistical Analysis

An analysis of Podcasts Reviews is presented in podcasts_statistical_analysis.ipynb

## Introduction
Dataset filled with over 2 million reviews and more than 100 thousands 
podcasts. Our goal of analysis is to make EDA for our dataset. Check for 
anomalies, correlations and other relations between features. We will perform 
statistical inference, form hypotheses base by what we find and create some 
dashboards using Looker Studio.
